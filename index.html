   	<h2> <u> What is HTML? </u> </h2> 
	<p> Html (Hyper Text Markup Language) is a standard markup language that is used for designing and creating webpages and applications. With CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and Javascript, 
	these webpages turn into beautiful modern work that is uploaded and published on the World Wide Web where many users may view the content. The World Wide Web is a network of 
	computers and this network lets them communicate with one another with the use of HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocal). </p>

	<h2> <u> How does HTML Work? </u> </h2>
	<p> HTML and CSS documents consists of lines of code which are typed up by the authors, editors and publishers. These lines of code are also refered to as "Tags".
	These documents are saved as either HTML files or CSS files and are saved in the same location.These documents are viewed through browsers such as Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. These 
	browsers read the text and translate it into visible content and the correct format which the authour has decided on. HTML documents should be written with proper tags and formatting 
	so the outcome is what you want. </p>

	<h3> <u> HTML, CSS, And Javascript </u> </h3> 
	<p> Websites are composed not only of HTML. If a website only has HTML, it will look plain, odd and unattractive to its audience. 
	This is why programmers intergrate CSS and Javascript.
	Each of these 3 components serve different functions when it comes to designing a webpage but they work really well together&#33; </p>
	<ul>
		<li> HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the base of the web page and it is generally used for structuring content. </li>
		<li> CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are used for applying visual graphics and styles. CSS is a programming language that is written to describe and add styles to HTML content. CSS also describes how HTML elements 
	should be displayed. With CSS, web designers can change the colors, backgrounds, borders, margins, padding, heights/widths, text, fonts, icons, links, lists, tables, and more&#33;</li>
		<li> Javascript should be used for almost all interactive functions. It is known to be a programming language for HTML and the World Wide Web.</li>
		<li> These 3 parts are crutial to web design and if the programer leaves one of these components out, the website wouldn&#39;t look as professional. These 3 conponents of web design can form many creative changes </li>

	<h3> <u>HTML Tags</u> </h3>
	<p> Tags are lines of code which are different from normal text. They have many functionalities that can brighten up the website. They are written between angular brakets and can provide 
the website with images, tables, colors and many more cool attributes. Different tags have different functions&#33; Tags themseleves don&#39;t have any output but their effects will. 
	<ul>
		<li> Example 1: <small> These words are small </small> but these aren&#39;t. </li>
	</ul>
	<p> In the example above, the small tags are placed before &ldquo;These &rdquo; and after &ldquo; small. &rdquo; The text that is between these small tags will make the text smaller than usual 
	but the other words that are between these tags won&#39;t have that effect </p>
	<ul>
		<li> Example 2: <b> <i> These words are bold and italic </i> </b> but these aren&#39;t. </li>
	</ul>
	<p> In the second example, there were two tags used; The bold tag and the italic tag. The bold tags are to make text bolder and emphasize key points while the italic text is a cursive writing that is also used to emphasize major points. These two tags were placed before &ldquo; These &rdquo; and after &ldquo; italic &rdquo;. The text that is between these two tags will have the effects but the other texts won&#39;t. </p>

	<h3> <u> HTML  Elements </u> </h3>
	<p> HTML elements are the &ldquo; building blocks &rdquo; of an HTML web page. Each element is an individual component of the HTML web page and has
	its content between the angular brackets (Start tags and End tags). </p> 
	<ul>
		<li> Example: This is a bullet point </li>
