	<h1> <u> The History of HTML</u> </h1> 
	<p> The history of HTML dates back to the 1980&#39;s. HTML all started when Tim Berners Lee was putting up his new browsing and authouring system 
	for the web. The problem with his idea is that the HTML code is text-based&#33; So anyone can use a word processor or an editor to convert,
	create, and edit web pages from the World Wide Web. A disadvantage is that anyone could pick up a few tags and master the HTMl 
	programming language. When more websites have been published on the web, programmers and web designers thought that these websites are
	really simple and need some improvements and upgrades. Because Tim Berners Lee didn&#39;t want to be the only developer of HTML, there were
	other programmers and web designers who helped along the way. 
	In 1993, a college student named Marc Andreessen addded the img tag to his Mosaic browser. Other contributers have said that <strong>img</strong> 
	is too limited and simple so they wanted to add other pieces of code like <strong>include</strong> or <strong>embed</strong> but Marc
	thought that it was way too early for that so he stuck with <strong> img </strong>. After that, Tim Berners Lee went off to the nascent 
	World Wide Web Consortium and Marc left for California to start his own browser company named &ldquo;Netscape.&rdquo;
	HTML continued to develop and the programmers and web developers made new lines of code. </p>
	<p> A few examples include... </p>
	<ul>
	<li> The Background Tag </li>
	<li> The Frame Tag </li>
	<li> The Font Tag </li>
	<li> The Blink Tag </li>
	</ul>
	<p> Then, Microsoft decided to contribute to the development of HTML and created tags. Their first tags were the <strong>Marquee</strong>
	tag, the <strong>Frame</strong> and the <strong>Bgsound</strong> tag. Later on in 1995, ,W3C has started to develop the HTML 3, a new HTML
	document that outlines new features, but no one decided to support it. If everything continues the way it was, Microsoft and Netscape will have 2 completely different types of HTML but without
	supporting the utopian vision&#33; This forced people to choose one browser to work with. They would have to choose between vendors or 
	spending more resources to create multiple versions of their orginal pages. </p>
	<p> The HTML arm of W3C decided to start something new, which was a much better idea. They scratched the old and unachievable ideas and started to 
	collect and record current practice in shipping broswers. Then W3C released HTML 3 to its audiences and started to work on their next project which was
	HTML 3.2.Microsoft worked with W3C for a while but they don&#39;t also agree together. Recently, they have argued over a <strong> layer </strong> tag 
	V.S. CSS positioning.Then HTML 4 came out which was followed by HTML 5 and HTML 5.1 in 2016. </p>
	<p> Now the newest HTML in 2017 would be HTMl 5.2. </p>
